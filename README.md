## Use Cases

- Blocking access to known malicious domains: the list can be used to block access to domains that are known to be used by malware, phishing, or other types of malicious activities.
- Monitoring network traffic: the list can be used to monitor network traffic and identify potential security threats or policy violations.
- Implementing parental controls: the list can be used to restrict access to certain domains that may be inappropriate or harmful for children.
- Implementing content filtering: the list can be used to filter out domains that contain specific types of content, such as adult content or gambling sites.
- Implementing ad-blocking: the list can be used to block domains that are known to serve ads, thereby improving the browsing experience and reducing the risk of malware infections.
- Enhancing privacy and security: the list can be used to block domains that are known to track user activity or collect personal information, thereby enhancing privacy and security.
